# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The project aimed at creating a web page with a dynamic responsive table.  Initially a filter option was creted to enable users filter UFOs sightings by date. Later the options were updated to include multiple fileds such as;
<ol>
  <li> city </li>
  <li> state </li>
  <li> country </li>
  <li> shape </li>
</ol>
To enable the search filds return results, for loops were creted.
